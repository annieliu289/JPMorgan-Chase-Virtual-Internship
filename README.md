# JPMorgan-Chase-Virtual-Internship
My work submitted for the [JPMorgan Chase Software Engineering Virtual Internship program](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/prototype/R5iK7HMxJGBgaSbvk/Technology%20Virtual%20Experience?ref=qgTKRCxm75aEgjsvB).

I completed a total of 3 tasks dealing with visualizing and analyzing share price data.

### Tasks
1. Interface with a stock price data feed and set up your system for analysis of the data.
2. Use JPMorgan Chase frameworks and tools; implement the Perspective open source code in preparation for data visualization.
3. Display data visually for traders: use Perspective to create the chart for the trader's dashboard.
